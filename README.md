# Google Case Study - Capstone Project
I used R to analyze a dataset from a fictional company, 'Cyclistic', a Chicago-based bike-share company. I produced a Tableau dashboard summarizing this data, and included key findings on how casual riders and annual members use the bike-sharing service. 

# Cyclistic
Founded in 2016, Cyclistic is a bike-share program that has over 5,800 and almost 700 docking stations throughout Chicago. The geotracked bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other Cyclistic station at any time. They offer multiple types of bikes to help make bike-share more inclusive. They offer single-ride passes, full-day passes, as well as annual memberships. Customers who purchase memberships are Cyclistic members while customers who opt for single-ride or full-day passes are considered casual riders.
